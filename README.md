# Rails of Thoughts Blog

This project was created for study purposes, aiming to learn new concepts and reinforce those I already have. The idea is to gradually add improvements, always evolving and learning along the way. At this initial stage, I am open to accepting issue requests but not pull requests, as this is a personal learning project.
